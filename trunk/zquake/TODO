Windows Client

.

Linux Client
------------
 
* Add the fix for non-dga keyboard input under Linux -
  http://www.shovelbeating.org/~windsok/keyboard.htm 

* Add strider's evdev input support

* Fix up HWGamma, affects the whole screen for gamma and blends, need to
  restore the gamma etc when you alt tab, lose focus, minimise etc.
  
* Speaking of alt-tab, work out how to make alt-tabbing work with GLX
  client.
 
* ALSA support maybe - oss emulation seems to work fine but native code is
  always better.
  
* Consider SDL for input

Windows/Linux Server
--------------------

* Allow rcon to save settings to a config? e.g. rcon writeconfig?

* Maplist - return *.bsp from id1/maps and $gamedir/maps

- free loaded wad3s every now and then
- don't Mod_ClearAll, use Mod_TouchModel like NetQuake
- FTE-style non-transparent protocol extension negotiation
- revert my fragmented backbuf stuff to QW's solid backbufs (the former give no advantage at all as I've realized)
